                             In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and
                             designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web
                             application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components
                             of a large website.

                             As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help
                             them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other
                             developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

                             Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and
                             specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as you’d like.

                             requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to

                             Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

                             size and position page elements. We also made our website responsive by incorporating media
                             queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.

                             contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are
